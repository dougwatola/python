    "The replace_ending function replaces the old string in a sentence with the new string, but only if the sentence ends with the old string. If there is more than one occurrence of the old string in the sentence, only the one at the end is replaced, not all of them. For example, replace_ending(\"abcabc\", \"abc\", \"xyz\") should return abcxyz, not xyzxyz or xyzabc. The string comparison is case-sensitive, so replace_ending(\"abcabc\", \"ABC\", \"xyz\") should return abcabc (no changes made). \n",
